# MusicSite-IntroToComputingAndMultimedia

The three pages I created are all structured similarly. At the top of the pages there is a short description of that certain type of music. Following that, is a table with the most popular song writers/singers in that specific music genre. Photos of each singer/songwriter are also included. Then there is a list of 10 well known songs of each genre. The names of the songs are hyperlinks to Youtube where the songs can be listened to. Lastly there is a list of instruments that are associated with each genre.
